/**
 *  ~~~ TO DO LIST ~~~
 *
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * ~~ NEW FEATURES ~~
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * TODO Complete Remote Job Creation - Need to get the rooms that need something done
 *
 * 1. Migrate some of the getJob functions from CreepManagers to Creep.Api to make code accessible by other CreepManagers
 *
 * 2. Complete Remote Miner
 * We want the remote miner to go to a source and mine it, build a container and his feet, and build/repair it during his down time.
 * We should also give remote miners 7 work parts imo. 6 wasn't enough to keep the container repaired and it was slow on building it
 * It is an extra 100 energy per creep cycle but I think its worth it to keep the remote rooms going smoother
 *
 * 3. Complete Remote Harvester
 * They are so simple, just get a container or pick up job in the remote room
 * Should be straight forward, bring the energy back and based on options, do harvester jobs with it
 *
 * 4. Complete Remote Reserver
 * Find reserve job in remote room and reserve it until death, basically a miner for the controller
 * We need to find a way to get the rooms that need to be reserver
 * Probably just put a value in room memory and simulate its down ticks like we did last code base, it worked really well
 *
 * 5. Complete Claimer
 * Find a claim job in a claim room and claim it
 * We need to find a way to get the rooms that need to be claimed (should be easier than finding ones that need to be reserved)
 *
 * 6. Complete Colonizer
 * Goes to remote room, mines for itself, builds the spawn, pumps energy into the spawn or upgrades until death
 *
 * Something to keep in mind on all these remote creeps, we need to make sure their travelTo calls get off exit (should just add to
 * all travel to methods, there are cases where we will send domestic creeps places as well)
 *
 * 7. Consider preferring closer jobs to further ones that are on the same level
 * Currently harvesters are kinda going from place to place when they could be filling up multiple on the way
 * to other extensions
 *
 * 8. Create a dismantler class, for example theres a room above me with 10m on ramparts, but its a dead room, and storage
 * has 1 mil in it. At this level I can make a 20 work, 6 move creep that could slice through the ramparts at a decent rate
 *
 * 9. Have some creeps possibly consider tombstones so we can pick up energy from invaders or allies
 * Def want this for remote harvesters, but possibly for workers too
 *
 * 10. Create a thief remote class that goes into enemy remote rooms and takes dropped energy or energy from the container
 * Consider using multiple of these flags to spawn multiple thieves, or consider using multiple of them to create a queue
 * of remote rooms for them to rotate to
 * Flag should be considered "done" after x amount of creep lives in case the enemies spawn defenders we don't wanna keep wasting energy
 *
 * 11. Create harrasser mili class that hit and runs enemy remote rooms and moves on to the next room in the queue before enemy creeps can respond to the threat
 * Can also have a flag that brings the harrasseer in with a thief as a squad to help defend it
 *
 * 12. Create tower drainer mili class
 * Thoughts to be determined
 *
 * 13. Consider spawning extra workers if X amount of construction sites appear (to assist with new level construction spikes)
 * Also make the system that spawns more workers in the case of remote rooms more reliable and cleanly coded (combine these systems preferrably)
 * into a function like getExtraWorkerAmount: number and add to the base amount of workers for that room state
 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * ~~ BUG FIXES ~~
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * 1. Harvesters need to fill extensions more efficiently - Choose closest, then check surrounding area for extensions before retargeting
 *
 * 2. It spawns 2 reservers when a remote room is placed, due to it not detecting the first one targeting the room yet.
 *
 * 3. UpgraderLink does not set itself in room memory - It should choose the one closest to spawn
 *          To be more useable, it should also reset if there is a closer link placed. This follows our rule of not forcing a gameplay style.
 *
 */

/**
 * local todo: short term
 *
 * fix getTargetRoom for military creeps..
 * its using attack rooms to find the target room
 * either find a way to keep attack rooms alive until the squad has all spawned, or find a way for it to use something else
 * preferably the first one, so we get to keep the attack flag up
 * would be nice also to find a way to just keep them up full time, but not feasable atm
 *
 * fix red + brown spawning squad instead of stalker solo
 *
 * start with zealot and examine its attack code, look for bugs
 *
 * switch to travelTo for military creeps, brock says its good
 *
 * fix squad stuff (after stalker examinization obv)
